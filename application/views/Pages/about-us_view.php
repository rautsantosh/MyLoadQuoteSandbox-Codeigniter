			    <p><strong>About MyLoanQuote</strong></p>

			    <p class="text-left lead">We offer a service that connects borrowers to lenders. There is no cost for submitting a loan application.
				<br><br>Fees and rates quoted come directly from our partners. We do not process and/or fulfill loan requests ourselves. Borrowers are under no obligation to accept the offer(s) presented.
			    </p>

			    <p><strong>How It Works?</strong></p>

			    <p class="text-left lead">The process is quick and easy!
				<br><br>Simplyâ€¦
				<br>1) Submit a loan application.
				<br>2) If your application is matched with a lender, they will contact you to complete the application process, review the terms of the loan and discuss repayment options. 
				<br>3) Once the application is approved and you have accepted the loan terms and electronically sign the loan agreement; funds will be deposited into your bank account.
				<br><br>To qualify you must:
				<br>- Be a U.S. citizen;
				<br>- Be 18 years of age;
				<br>- Have a valid checking or savings account;
				<br>- Have a minimum monthly income of $800.</p>

			    <p><strong>What happens if I don't pay the loan back on time or at all?</strong></p>

			    <p class="text-left lead"> You are agreeing to pay a loan back once accepting the terms and conditions of the loan offered. Partial payment, non-payment or late payment may result in additional fees, legal collection actions and/or your failure to pay being reported to a consumer reporting agency.
				<br><br>Each lender has differing conditions and terms for their loans. Many lenders are willing to work with you if you should need some help. If you have questions or need more information please call the lender directly. If you have any issue contacting them, then please let MyLoanQuote know.</p>

			    <p><strong>What is the renewal policy for these types of loans?</strong></p>

			    <p class="text-left lead">Every lender has different Renewal policies. Some lenders may agree to alternative payment options resulting in a renewed loan and additional loan fees. Please make sure to review your lender's renewal policies and make your payment preferences known to your lender. If you have questions or need more information on renewal policies, please call your lender directly. Please let them know that you were matched with them through MyLoanQuote and they will be happy to assist. If you have any issue contacting them, then please let MyLoanQuote know.</p>

			    <p><strong>Disclosure of Renewal Policy</strong></p>

			    <p class="text-left lead">Extending the repayment terms of a loan may result in additional interest paid, as well as late fees, which can significantly increase the total amount you pay back on a loan. In most cases the loan renewal policies are regulated by the state government.</p>

				    *Funding times and loan amounts may vary. Users of this website may not meet the lending criteria to qualify for a loan. The majority of applicants will not qualify for a personal loan and many who are presented with a loan offer will only receive a short-term lending option up to $1,000. The APR on a personal loan from our network of lenders can range from 5.99% to 35.99%, with loan durations between 3 and 60 months. For Example: Borrow $2,000 for 12 months, with a 19.9% representative APR and a monthly repayment of $183.63. Total repayment will be $2,203.56.</small></div>
