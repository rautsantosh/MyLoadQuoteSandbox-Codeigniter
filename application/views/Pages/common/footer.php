		<p><small>THE OPERATOR OF THIS 
			WEBSITE IS NOT A LENDER, does not make credit decisions, and does not 
			charge Consumers any fees. This website does not constitute an offer or 
			solicitation to lend, rather it provides a service wherein we submit 
			the information you provide to one or more lenders and attempt to search
			for a lender to meet your needs. This service is not available in all 
			states, and the states serviced by this Website may change from time to 
			time and without notice. Providing your information on this Website does
			not guarantee that we will be able to locate a lender to meet your 
			needs or that you will be approved for a loan. The lender may perform a 
			credit check or otherwise verify the information you provide. Not all 
			lending partners offer loans up to the advertised amount and not all 
			lenders can provide you with the loan amount you requested. Loan amounts
			are determined by the lender based on individual creditworthiness. All 
			financial terms of the loan, including annual percentage rate ("<span class="b-gray">APR</span>"),
			fees, charges, and repayment period will be provided to you by the 
			lender and may vary by lender, state, and your individual 
			creditworthiness. You are NOT required to accept the terms of the loan 
			that a lender offers you. If you don't agree with or don't like the 
			terms of the loan offered by the lender, <span class="b-gray">do not</span> electronically sign the loan documents.</small></p>

		<p><small>For details, questions, or concerns regarding your loan please
			contact your lender directly. In some situations, faxing or emailing of
			documents may be required. Cash transfer times may vary between lenders
			and may depend on your individual financial institution. Loan repayment
			periods vary by lender and state. Not all Consumers will meet the 
			lending criteria to qualify for a loan and many consumers may only 
			qualify for short-term lending options. <b>Personal loan services are not offer by some of our partners in the following states: AR, CT, NY, SD, VT, WV.</small></b></p>

		<p><small>Borrow Responsibly – A short-term loan is an expensive form of
			credit intended for short-term financial needs only, not as a long-term
			financial solution. Late or missed loan payments may result in 
			additional finance charges and fees, your account falling into 
			collections, and may negatively impact your credit history.  Lenders may
			use collection services for nonpayment of loans. Consumers experiencing
			credit difficulties should seek credit counseling or meet with a 
			nonprofit financial counseling service in their community.  If you cannot make a payment on time, you should contact your lender immediately and discuss how to handle late payments. Lenders are required to follow the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act and related state law when collecting money from you.</small></p>

		<p><small>Consumer Advisory - Our lender partners will never ask for an 
			advance payment. NEVER pay a lender in advance for a loan. Do not wire 
			or transfer money. Do not send pre-paid cards. Do not provide personal 
			information to anyone asking for an advance payment in order to receive a
			loan.</small></p>

		<p><small>Lender Terms Disclosure – The lender aligned with you application will provide documents that contain all fees and rate information pertaining to the loan offered, including any potential fees for late-payments and the rules under which you may be allowed (if permitted by applicable law) to refinance, renew or rollover your loan. Fees and interest rates are determined solely by the lender based on their internal policies, underwriting criteria and applicable law. MyLoanQuote.net has no knowledge of or control over the loan terms offered by a lender. You are urged to read and understand the terms of any loan offered by any lender, whether tribal or state-licensed, and to reject any particular loan offer that you cannot afford to repay or that includes terms that are not acceptable to you.</small></p>

		<p><small>Under Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT ACT, in order to help the
			government fight identity theft, the funding of terrorism and money 
			laundering activities, and to help attempt to verify a customer's 
			identity, lenders may obtain, verify, and record information identifying
			the customer. Lenders may ask for additional identifying information 
			(i.e. driver's license documentation), in conjunction with running 
			credit reports.</small></p>
