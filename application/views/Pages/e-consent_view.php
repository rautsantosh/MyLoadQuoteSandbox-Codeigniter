			    <p>MYLOANQUOTE.NET CONSENT FOR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES, RECORDS, AND DISCLOSURES (the "<span style='border-bottom:1px solid #333;'>Electronic Consent Agreement</span>")</p>

			    <p class="text-left lead">Please read this information carefully and print a copy and/or retain this information for future reference.</p>

			    <p class="text-left lead"><strong>Introduction.</strong> You are submitting a request to be connected to a third party lender who may be able to offer you a loan. In order to offer you a loan, the third party lenders need your consent to use and accept electronic signatures, records, and disclosures ("<span style='border-bottom:1px solid #333;'>E-Consent</span>" or "<span style='border-bottom:1px solid #333;'>Electronic Consent</span>"). This form notifies you of your rights when receiving electronic disclosures, notices, and information. By clicking on the link assenting to our terms, you acknowledge that you received this E-Consent and that you consent to conduct transactions using electronic signatures, electronic disclosures, electronic records, and electronic contract documents ("<span style='border-bottom:1px solid #333;'>Disclosures</span>").</p>

			    <p class="text-left lead"><strong>Option for Paper or Non-Electronic Records.</strong> You may request any Disclosures in paper copy by contacting the third party lender directly. The lenders will provide paper copies at no charge. The lenders will retain all Disclosures as applicable law requires.</p>

			    <p class="text-left lead"><strong>Scope of Consent.</strong> This E-Consent applies to all online interactions concerning you and the third party lender and includes those interactions engaged on any mobile device, including phones, smart-phones, and tablets. By exercising this E-Consent, the third party lender may process your information and interact with you electronically. The lender may also send you notices electronically related to its interactions and transactions. Disclosures may be provided online at our or third party lenders' websites, and may be provided by e-mail.</p>

			    <p class="text-left lead"><strong>Consenting to Do Business Electronically.</strong> Before you decide to do business electronically with the third party lenders, you should consider whether you have the required hardware and software capabilities described below.</p>

			    <p class="text-left lead"><strong>Hardware and Software Requirements.</strong> To access and retain the Disclosures electronically, you will need to use the following computer software and hardware: A PC or MAC compatible computer or other device capable of accessing the Internet, access to an e-mail account, and an Internet Browser software program that supports at least 128 bit encryption, such as Microsoft&reg; Internet Explorer, Netscape&reg; or Mozilla Firefox&reg;. To read some documents, you may need a PDF file reader like Adobe&reg; Acrobat Reader X&reg; or Foxit&reg;. You will need a printer or a long-term storage device, such as your computer's disk drive, to retain a copy of the Disclosures for future reference. You may send any questions regarding the hardware and software requirements directly to the third party lenders.</p>

			    <p class="text-left lead"><strong>Withdrawing Consent.</strong> Your E-Consent for our Services (as defined in Digitech Web Resources Terms and Conditions) and for our third party lenders' consideration of your loan request cannot be withdrawn because it is a one-time transaction. If you are referred to one or more third party lenders, you are free to withdraw your E-Consent directly from those third party lenders at any time and at no charge. However, if you withdraw this E-Consent before receiving credit, you may be prevented from obtaining credit from the lender. Contact the third party lender directly if you wish to withdraw your E-consent as it pertains to any particular lender. If you decide to withdraw this E-Consent, the legal effectiveness, validity, and enforceability of prior electronic Disclosures will not be affected.</p>

			    <p class="text-left lead"><strong>Change to Your Contact Information.</strong> You should keep third party lenders informed of any change in your electronic address or mailing address. You may update such information by logging into the third party lender's website or by sending the lender a written update by mail.</p>
